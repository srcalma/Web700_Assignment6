                        on third-party plugins like Flash.</li>

                    <li><strong>Canvas:</strong> The <i>canvas</i> element allows for dynamic rendering of graphics,
                        animations, and interactive visualizations using JavaScript.</li>

                        features for forms, making it easier to build user-friendly and accessible forms.</li>

                    <li><strong>Improved APIs:</strong> HTML5 provides a range of new JavaScript APIs for working with
                        geolocation, web storage, offline applications, drag and drop, and more.</li>
